Create a Screen (UI is not important) which is having a count down timer from 30 mins.  I can add a number of timers. If we close the app without stopping the timer, we need to save the timer in the async storage and restart it from the stopped interval. 



1. Screen will list active timers

2. Click on button to add the timer

3.  The timer will start counting down from 30 mins

4. Button on each timer to delete timer

5. If app is closed and resumed the timer should show countdown from original start time. i.e. If i start a timer counting down 30 mins at 11:30 and than close the app. When i open the app again at 11:45 than it should show the timer at 15 mins and counting down.
